<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Atomistic Simulations for Studying Phonon-mediated Thermal Energy Transport in Materials</h2> 
My research work focuses on using atomistic simulations (lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics) to study and understand the phonon-mediated thermal energy transport in materials for energy applications. Phonons, which are the quantized lattice vibrations, are the predominant heat energy carriers in non-metallic crystalline materials. A detailed review of the theory and advancements in the lattice-dynamics method for the calculation of thermal conductivity is given in the following article.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Studying Phonon-mediated Thermal Energy Transport in ThO<sub>2</sub> Using Atomistic Simulations</h2> 

### 1. [Considerations for ab-initio based thermal conductivity prediction of ThO<sub>2</sub>](https://ishmtdigitallibrary.com/conferences/1654896405e56590,4869f8107409fb40,0a91fd4e3534321c.html)
Actinide oxides like uranium dioxide and mixed oxides are the primary fuel materials used in nuclear reactors around the globe. Thorium dioxide (ThO<sub>2</sub>) is a promising material from the actinide oxide family that can be considered as an alternative to replace the aforementioned nuclear fuels. Understanding the thermal energy transport in nuclear fuel materials is crucial, as it directly impacts the safety and efficiency of nuclear reactors. In this work, ab initio calculations are used to determine the lattice thermal conductivity of ThO<sub>2</sub> at different temperatures. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and density functional theory (DFT), along with lattice dynamics calculations, are used to predict the harmonic and anharmonic phonon properties of ThO<sub>2</sub>, which are then used to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of the material. The results from ab initio calculations are compared with experimentally reported values and are in good agreement. The effect of temperature-dependent inter-atomic force constants (IFC) on the predicted thermal conductivity is investigated. It is found that these temperature-dependent IFCs affect the accuracy of predicted thermal conductivity for ThO<sub>2</sub> crystals.

### 2. [Revisiting thermal transport in ThO<sub>2</sub> using higher-order thermal transport physics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2025.113882)
The effect of inclusion of higher-order thermal transport physics (viz. temperature-dependent interatomic force constants, phonon renormalization, and four-phonon scattering) on the computation of phonon frequencies and lattice thermal conductivity of ThO<sub>2</sub> is explored, employing LDA, PBE, and PBEsol exchangeâ€“correlation functionals. Upon renormalization, the frequencies are stiffened for the optical phonon modes, whereas the acoustic modes remain unchanged. Thermal conductivity computed using LDA and PBEsol functionals is within 5% of the experimentally measured values at 300 K, whereas that obtained using PBE functional results in an underprediction of 25%. The temperature-dependent force constants and renormalized phonon frequencies significantly affect the computed lattice thermal conductivity at higher temperatures (40% difference at 1000 K), whereas four-phonon processes have minimal effects (only 10% at 1000 K).
