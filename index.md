# About Me
I am a researcher, doing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [(IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). 

I am part of the Materials Research Lab [(MRL)](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~a_jain/) at IITB, where we use computational methods to predict and understand the thermal energy transport in materials using ab-initio methods. 

My work focuses on understanding the phonon-driven thermal energy transport in nuclear fuel materials.
